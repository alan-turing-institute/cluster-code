"""
Counts the number of occurrences of words per-year and groups by
word.

The query expects a file with a list of the words to search for, one
per line.

Words are normalized, by removing all 'a-z|A-Z' characters before
comparing with the list of words to search for.

The result is of form, for example:

    WORD:
    - [YEAR, N]
    - [YEAR, N]
    - ...
    WORD:
    ...

Only words that occur one or more times are returned.
