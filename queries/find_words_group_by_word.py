"""
Counts the number of occurrences of words per-year and groups by
word. The query expects a file with a list of the words to search for,
one per line.

The result is of form, for example:

    WORD:
    - [YEAR, N]
    - [YEAR, N]
    - ...
    WORD:
    ...

Only words that occur one or more times are returned.
